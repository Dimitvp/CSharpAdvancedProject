# CSharpAdvancedProject - Encryption algorithm

<div><h2>What is the project about?</h2></div>
</br>
<div><h5>The project is encrypting algorithm made with the idea to serve as back up encryption. What this means is that it is used before the main algorithm for encrypting data is used in order to make the life of a hacker into a living hell.</h5></div>
<div><h3>How did we achieved our goal?</h3></div>
</br>
<div><h5> The algorithm uses a sequence to mess up the text. The sequence represents certain order in which different methods are invoked. The sequence determines what the algorithm will do and how hell it will do it. Changing the sequence changes the algorithm to a level it is imposible to compare one version with another. This means that if you download it and change the sequence you will have your own version which no one else will have. By doing this, you will make it impossible for a hacker to hack it, since he/she would have no ide how the text was encrypted, as long as he/she doesn't have access to your server. If they do - you are doomed anyway since every encryption is made to be decrypted and if they have access and know all of the keys and algorithms - you stand no chance in protecting your data.<h5></div>
